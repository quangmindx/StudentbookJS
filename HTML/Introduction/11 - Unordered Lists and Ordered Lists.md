# Unordered Lists

In addition to organizing text in paragraph form, you can also display content in an easy-to-read list.

In HTML, you can use an *unordered* list tag (`<ul>`) to create a list of items in no particular order. An unordered list outlines individual *list items* with a bullet point.

The `<ul>` element should not hold raw text and wonâ€™t automatically format raw text into an unordered list of items. Individual list items must be added to the unordered list using the `<li>` tag. The `<li>` or list item tag is used to describe an item in a list.

``` HTML
    <ul>
        <li>Limes</li>
        <li>Tortillas</li>
        <li>Chicken</li>
    </ul>
```

In the example above, the list was created using the `<ul>` tag and all individual list items were added using `<li>` tags.


# Ordered Lists

*Ordered lists* (`<ol>`) are like unordered lists, except that each list item is numbered. They are useful when you need to list different steps in a process or rank items for first to last.

You can create the ordered list with the `<ol>` tag and then add individual list items to the list using `<li>` tags.

``` HTML
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.</li>
        <li>Mix whole wheat flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>Cream the butter, sugar in separate bowl.</li>
        <li>Add eggs and vanilla extract to bowl.</li>
    </ol>
```
