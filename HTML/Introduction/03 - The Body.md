# The Body

One of the key HTML elements we use to build a webpage is the *body* element. Only content inside the opening and closing body tags can be displayed to the screen. Here’s what opening and closing body tags look like:

``` HTML
    <body>

    </body>
```
Once the file has a body, many different types of content – including text, images, and buttons – can be added to the body.

``` HTML
    <body>
        <p>What's up, doc?</p>
    </body>
```

### Instructions
1. Add a body to your web page using the `<body>` element.
2. Add the following code between your opening and closing body tags:
``` HTML
