# Introduction to HTML

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language:

* A *markup* language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text.
* In HTML, the computer can interpret *raw text* that is wrapped in HTML elements.
* *HyperText* is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links, also known as hyperlinks. You probably clicked on a couple of *hyperlinks* on your way to this Codecademy course.

Learning `HTML` is the first step in creating websites, but even a bit of knowledge can help you inject code snippets into newsletter, blog or website templates. As you continue learning, you can layer `HTML` with `CSS` and `JavaScript` to create visually compelling and dynamic websites.
