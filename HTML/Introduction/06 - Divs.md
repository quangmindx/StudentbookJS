# Divs

One of the most popular elements in HTML is the `<div>` element. `<div>` is short for “division” or a container that divides the page into sections. These sections are very useful for grouping elements in your HTML togethe

``` HTML
    <body>
        <div>
            <h1>Why use divs?</h1>
            <p>Great for grouping elements!</p>
        </div>
    </body>
```
`<div>`s don’t inherently have a visual representation, but they are very useful when we want to apply custom styles to our HTML elements. `<div>`s allow us to group HTML elements to apply the same styles for all HTML elements inside.

`<div>`s can contain any text or other HTML elements, such as links, images, or videos. Remember to always add two spaces of indentation when you nest elements inside of `<div>`s for better readability.
